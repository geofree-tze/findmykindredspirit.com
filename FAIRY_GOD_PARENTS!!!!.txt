I don't actually believe in Fairy God Parents.
But I do believe in "kindred spirits" aka someone you have A FUCK TON in common with.

For reasons I'd rather not get into, I became obsessed.
Specifically, I wanted to find someone who's 1) a fan of Lil Peep 2) a fan of GaryVee and 3) is eurasian.
I know there's millions of each around the world. But finding someone with ALL 3 traits? 
Now that's ultra-rare! Call it Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon.

It's some nerd shit, but I read about this thing called the Birthday Paradox.
It said that with just 23 people, there's a 50-50 chance someone has the same birthday.
Basically, exponents are f*cking magic.

And what's cool is you can use this shizz not just for birthday matching
but also music, TV shows, video games, academics, hobbies, anything really...

So yeah, basically I believe that personality doppelgangers exist
aka freaks of nature that have AN UNGODLY AMOUNT in common.
Which is why I created this website!

I wanted to put this whacko hypothesis to the test :)
I'm like Mr. Crocker trying to prove that Fairy God Parents exist.
EXTREME KINDRED SPIRITS!! ðŸ¤ª
