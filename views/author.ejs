	<span style="font-size:21px;font-weight:bold;">Long story short, </span> I was 21 years old and isolated in my room.

	<br>
	<br>

	The only thing that kept me company at the time
	<br>
	was 1) music by Lil Peep
	<br>
	and 2) videos by Gary Vee.
	<br>
	<span style="font-size:12px;">
	(btw, I'm eurasian)
	</span>

	<br>
	<br>
	<br>

	I thought, &ldquo;what if there's someone out there?
	<br>
	Someone who's eurasian, listens to Lil Peep, and follows Gary Vee like me<i>!</i>&rdquo;

	I went from depressive to manic.
	<br>
	I was <b>in the zone</b>.
	<br>
	I knew <u>exactl</u>y what I wanted.
	<br>
	Eating and sleeping became pit stops.
